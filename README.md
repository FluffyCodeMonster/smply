Simple Motion Planning Library in pYthon 

## Installation

Just download to a folder using either git or the 'download zip' button.  This isnot formally arranged as a Python package.

### Dependencies

You will need:
- Python (`sudo apt install python` on Linux or install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) on Windows)
- numpy, matplotlib, Jupyter notebook and [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/install.html) (all come with Anaconda, or `pip install numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter` on Linux)
- PuLP (`pip install pulp` on Linux or `conda install -c conda-forge pulp` at the Anaconda prompt)

## Contents

The library consists of a collection of Jupyter notebooks that illustrate how each method works.  Hopefully the titles of each indicate what's in them, and they have comments to describe the process.
